You will find here the relevents informations about my tech profile (education, work experience) and also the different project I have realyse to train and improve my competencies.

## About me:

Passionate about new technologies and a lover of mathematics with a creative spirit, I am a fast learner, always eager to expand my knowledge. My academic background and professional experience have given me a dual expertise in both business and technology, allowing me to bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions. I excel at creating dashboards, analyses, and predictive models that cater directly to business requirements, and I can communicate complex technical issues in simple/understandable terms for non technical teams. I have a strategic perspective, able to assess the big picture while also deconstructing it to identify problems or uncover optimization opportunities.

My creativity is one of my strongest assets, driving me to think outside the box when developing solutions and crafting innovative approaches to complex problems.  This creativity allows me not only to address business challenges but also to envision and implement solutions that are both effective and forward-thinking.

### Digital Marketing Assistant | Zankyou (January 2022 - July 2022)### 

Before starting my internship, I had zero experience with SEA. Within two weeks, I was already handling things independently. A great example of this: two weeks in, my manager (the only one managing Google and Meta Ads) went on a two-week vacation, leaving me fully in charge. I was nervous about managing the budget, so I created a Data Studio dashboard to track our daily spend. It turned out to be a good move—three days before she returned, I noticed we were under budget, so I reallocated funds across campaigns to make sure we stayed on track.

**SEA - SEM**
- Creation of visuals 
- Creation of campaigns (google, meta, linkedin)
- Analysis of results (data studio, google analytics)
- Budget management (about 40000€/month) 
- Optimization of campaigns
- A/B testing

**Project management**
When I arrived at Zankyou, I was supposed to work exclusively on digital marketing campaigns. However, I soon noticed that there were a number of problems/unnecessary actions causing loss of time and efficiency, and above all that the simple digital tools available to the teams were not being used or were being misused. So I started training myself in these various tools, and then came up with some solutions. 

- Redesign of the data studio environment
- Automatic keyword analysis
- Link of the various data sources
  - Creation of new campaign formats (audiences, videos, campaign types, etc.) 
  

I then went on to develop a data-driven strategy, which I used to write my bachelor thesis. 
- Campaing scoring
- Detailed analysis of the customers
- Creation of a

## About me:

Passionate about new technologies and a lover of mathematics with a creative spirit, I am a fast learner, always eager to expand my knowledge. My academic background and professional experience have given me a dual expertise in both business and technology, allowing me to bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions. I excel at creating dashboards, analyses, and predictive models that cater directly to business requirements, and I can communicate complex technical issues in simple/understandable terms for non technical teams. I have a strategic perspective, able to assess the big picture while also deconstructing it to identify problems or uncover optimization opportunities.

My creativity is one of my strongest assets, driving me to think outside the box when developing solutions and crafting innovative approaches to complex problems.  This creativity allows me not only to address business challenges but also to envision and implement solutions that are both effective and forward-thinking.

## Work Experience

I've always been drawn to the data sector and motivated by the opportunity to bridge the gap between business teams and tech teams. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve consistently pursued roles in tech environments with a focus on analysis.

### Digital Marketing Assistant | Zankyou (January 2022 - July 2022)

Before starting my internship, I had zero experience with SEA. Within two weeks, I was already handling things independently. A great example of this: two weeks in, my manager (the only one managing Google and Meta Ads) went on a two-week vacation, leaving me fully in charge. I was nervous about managing the budget. So I took the opportunity to create a dashboard in data studio in order to track our daily spending. It turned out to be a good moveâ€”three days before she returned, I noticed we were under budget, so I reallocated funds across campaigns to make sure we stayed on track.

**SEA - SEM**
- Creation of visuals 
- Creation of campaigns (google, meta, linkedin)
- Analysis of results (data studio, google analytics)
- Budget management (about 40000â‚¬/month) 
- Optimization of campaigns
- A/B testing

**Project management**
Initially my role was to work exclusively on digital marketing campaigns. However, I soon noticed that there were a number of problems/unnecessary actions causing waste of time and inefficiencies. In addition to that, Iâ€™ve identified that existing digitals tools were either not used or used wrongly by the team. Therefore, I proactively decided to train myself in these tools in order to propose new solutions and ways of working. 

- Redesign of the data studio environment
- Automatic keyword analysis
- Link of the various data sources
  - Creation of new campaign formats (audiences, videos, campaign types, etc.) 
  

At the end of this internship I decided in collaboration with my manager to develop and present a data driven strategy that the team could implement:
- Campaing scoring
- Detailed analysis of the customers
- Creation of a
